# GPTEnergyBot
A ChatGPT-based bot, done with simple prompts

This prompts are used and tested with ChatGPT Plus (Model 4.0)
As the target audience of this project is the german energy retail sector, all prompts and data is given and used in german.
The resulting behaviour of chatGPT using the given prompts are impressive, however not even closely complete to provide a sound chatbot for a german energy provider.
Furthermore it is questionable if it is suitable for production use, as private user data must be given to the model. It remains in doubt if this is legally possible. 
The prompts should be used as a showcase, of what is possible with current LLMs

# HowTo
Just use the prompt in "bot.prompt" first and than feel free to interact with the bot. The file user.prompt includes some suggestions for meaningful usecases.
